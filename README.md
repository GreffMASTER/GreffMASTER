**Hello there!**  
I like to tinker with games and create ones of my own.  
My three main langauges I'm "good at" are:  
- Python
- Lua
- C/C++

My current interests revolve around understanding and modding TrackMania games.  
I've made multiple tools to help with the GBX format, such as [GBXLZO](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/GBXLZO) and [GBXCompiler](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/gbxc).
